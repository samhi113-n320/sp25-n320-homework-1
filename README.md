## Assignment 1: Full-Stack Development Recap

### Full-Stack Web Development

Full-Stack Development is combining the front and back ends of development into one process. Front-end consists of development of the interfaces the user will interact with, such as the HTML, CSS, and event listeners. Back-end consists of developing the connections and databases for the site. Back-end typically consists of more scripting and functionality testing whereas front-end will consist more of user testing and examination of the best ways to interact with the site.

### Node.js Understanding

Node.js is a library of packages mainly centered around web development. Whether its for package management, enabling compiling different files into one, launching a local server, or just enabling a console, Node's package manager, NPM, allows for all to be done through the package.json file.

### Version Control, Git, & GitHub

Version Control, such as Git and Github, is how projects manage different versions and releases of software. It allows for remote development and collaboration between team members at the same time. Git is a very popular version control method, with GitHub being a web-based interface for Git. GitHub allows for quick and easy management of a project's files. GitHub also manages permissions for repositories, so trusted users can collaborate and/or contribute with the project.

### Markdown & Documentation

Markdown is a method of documentation, styled to allow for hierarchy of tools to be easily implemented. HTML stands for HyperText Markdown Language, meaning the structure of sites stems from Markdown. Documentation of projects is important as it allows for reflection, analysis, and reference for work done. In my job working with UITS, we document every client interaction for both sides' usage. Need proof you're suffering with a tech issue? The ticket (or documentation) we created allows for easy proof of said issue.
